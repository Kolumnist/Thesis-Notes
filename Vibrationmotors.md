# Vibrationmotors

## ERM

RPM = Revolutions Per Minute
Hz = Cycles per Second
Vibration Frequency (Hz) = RPM / 60

F = Centripetal Force (N)
m = Mass of Eccentric Mass (kg)
r = "Eccentricity" of Eccentric Mass (m) (radius of the shaft to the edge of rotating object)
w = Angular Velocity (rads^-1) (speed of the motor)
F = m \* r \* w²
Amplitude = F/m (For 1 Amplitude unit G being equal to 9.8ms²)

The higher the voltage the faster and the stronger the vibration.

## LRA

Very Efficient

Linear movement up and down.
